# 🎯 Project Statement: Simple Library Management System

## ⚠️ Problem Statement
[cite_start]The lack of a structured, digital mechanism to track library inventory and lending status leads to manual errors and delays in determining a book's availability[cite: 99]. [cite_start]This project addresses the critical need for a simple, automated inventory and lending status tracker[cite: 99].

## 🗺️ Scope of the Project
[cite_start]The scope is strictly limited to **console-based operations** [cite: 100][cite_start]: book creation, book listing, and status updates (checkout/return)[cite: 100].

* [cite_start]**In-Scope:** Uses **volatile memory** (a global list) for runtime data storage[cite: 100].
* [cite_start]**Out-of-Scope:** Does **not** include persistent data storage (database/file I/O) or user authentication[cite: 100].

## 👤 Target Users
This tool is designed for efficient, small-scale library management:

* [cite_start]📚 A **Librarian** or **administrator** responsible for maintaining a small catalog[cite: 102].
* [cite_start]🎓 A **Student** or **individual** needing to manage their personal book collection[cite: 102].

## 💡 High-Level Features
The system provides two core capabilities:

1.  [cite_start]**📦 Inventory Management (Add/View)**[cite: 103]: The ability to track and list all available books.
2.  [cite_start]**🔄 Status Tracking (Checkout/Return)**[cite: 103]: The functionality to quickly update a book's lending status.
